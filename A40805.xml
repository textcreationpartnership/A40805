            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Have in the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, undertaken a Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of thoſe publick <hi>Loyal
<pb facs="tcp:94072:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>Declarations</hi> of this Church and Kingdom, which are of great concernment, not only in the Civil Government, but alſo in the <hi>Chriſtian Religion:</hi> and I hope your Grace will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not account it improper that this ſhould be preſented unto your ſelf. For the chief things I have taken upon me to defend, are ſuch ſpecial Branches of the <hi>Doctrine of our Church,</hi> that in this part and Age of the World, they are in a manner peculiar to it, and to them who with it have herein imbraced the true Reformed profeſſion. But both the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and divers other different <hi>Sects</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94072:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>and parties, among their other Errours and Hereſies, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch diſloyal Poſitions as are of dangerous importance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Government, wherein (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſome other things) there is too near a Conjunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
            <p>And theſe things are of ſo great conſequence in <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> that the main Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Righteouſneſs, Peace, and Obedience are thereby eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, all which neceſſary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are much inſiſted on by our Saviours Doctrine. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the regular and orderly beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of inferiour Relations, is particularly enjoined, for the
<pb facs="tcp:94072:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>gaining reputation to our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; becauſe a temper fitted for Chriſtian ſubjection, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth Pride, Paſſion, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs to be ſubdued; and that in the fear of God, an Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Meek, and peaceable Spirit is introduced, which are things wherein our Saviour hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us his Example.</p>
            <p>And the principal matter of this Diſcourſe concerning the <hi>Kings Supremacy in all Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and the <hi>unlawfulneſs of Subjects taking Armes,</hi> is of the greater concernment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the contrary ill Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which many have imbibed, have been very pernicious to
<pb facs="tcp:94072:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſeveral parts of the World, for many hundred years paſt. Which hurtful Poſitions have prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the more among men, by their being covered over with plauſible pretences: as if thoſe of the former ſort were needful, to aſſert the juſt intereſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Chriſtian <hi>Church;</hi> and thoſe of the latter ſort, to provide for the ſafety of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Mans own propriety. All which would repreſent the <hi>ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Authority,</hi> which was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by divine wiſdom for the good of Mankind, to be a thing exceeding hurtful and miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to the World.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:94072:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Wherefore ſince men are much led by the conſideration of their <hi>intereſts,</hi> that what I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe may be the more ſucceſsful and effectual; I have ſhewed that Obedience, and peaceable ſubjection to Governours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſiſtance, is not only a <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which is enough to perſwade all good men to practiſe it, but that it is the common <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> of the World, as the whole duty of Man is, both to Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and to Subjects. And that Royal <hi>Supremacy</hi> in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, is not prejudicial to the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> I have only expreſſed more covertly and ſuccinctly; becauſe though
<pb facs="tcp:94072:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>this may be conſidered by ſome men, there is another intereſt, to wit, that of the boundleſs ambition and avarice of the <hi>Romiſh Court</hi> and Church, which chiefly inſtigates their oppoſition hereunto: and I muſt confeſs that the truth I defend, doth not gratify this intereſt. But that tendeth beſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the advantages of the Church in the World, when the goodneſs of our Religion, and its preſerving all juſt rights of Superiours as well as others, doth ſo recommend it to the World, as may gain to it the good opinion of all men, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Princes, and the bleſſing of God.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:94072:6"/>
            <p>And though I am conſcious to my ſelf, that by reaſon of the greatneſs and copiouſneſs of the ſubject I have taken in hand, there may be ſeveral defects in my performances, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my diligent endeavours; yet I preſume humbly to tender them to your <hi>Grace,</hi> in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that your Candor, and readineſs to give a favourable acceptance to well deſigned, and not unuſeful undertakings, and to make charitable allowances for their imperfections, doth bear an equal proportion with other parts of your great worth, by reaſon of which you poſſeſs your great dignity with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb facs="tcp:94072:6"/>ſatisfaction to good men, and the Friends of Truth and Peace. And that you may long and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily continue here to the benefit of the Church, and may ſee the Church it ſelf in Proſperity, and true Piety flouriſhing, all the dayes of your Life, is the deſire and Prayer of him,</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Government and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this Realm requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a ſolemn acknowledgment to be made, by all who bear any office therein, concerning the <hi>Regal Power</hi> and Dignity; and the different par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties uſing their ſeveral methods and pretences, to oppoſe the matters of theſe publick Declarations; I have endeavoured in the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, to give a true and clear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of theſe things, in order to the removing thoſe miſtakes or doubts, which may either perplex any perſons, or tempt them to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their duty. And I have oft thought, that thoſe things which are <hi>publickly profeſſed</hi> in this Church and Realm, by theſe particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments,
<pb facs="tcp:94072:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>which are made by ſo many perſons, are very uſeful to be diſcourſed of; both becauſe theſe things themſelves were ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as being of great concernment, by the grave and prudent conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of publick Authority, and the due complyance with them inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the practiſing Obedience, and <hi>following the things which make for Peace;</hi> and alſo becauſe the unjuſt oppoſitions made againſt theſe things, are either managed by ill deſigns, or at leaſt have a tendency to promote ill effects in Church and State. And the truth which in this Diſcourſe I undertake to maintain, doth alſo ſpeak much the Integrity and Simplicity of the <hi>Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> that it is not a Worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, or a way laid to intitle any Profeſſors thereof to claim, or to enable them to uſurp upon, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the temporal Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
<pb facs="tcp:94072:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>as hath been ſhamefully done in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not a little by other ſorts of men: a conſiderable part of the Popiſh U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpations being founded, in their unjuſt <hi>encroaching</hi> upon the Rights of Soveraignty.</p>
            <p>And they who have obſerved the State of the World, cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, what Horrid and Miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Conſpiracies, have been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently contrived, againſt the Safety and Welfare of Princes, and their Kingdoms; as the conſequent of the wicked Poſitions which I have undertaken to refute. But all theſe attempts, which are Pernicious and Deſtructive to Humane Society, will, I hope, ſufficiently appear by the following Diſcourſe, to be perfectly oppoſite to the Chriſtian Doctrine alſo, and ſeverely condemned by it. Wherefore the things treated of in this Book, are of ſuch a nature, that
<pb facs="tcp:94072:9"/>they are of great concernment, for the good Order, Peace and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World; the ſecurity of Kings and Kingdoms; and the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating the Innocency of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>Upon this Account, I could wiſh my ſelf to be more able to diſcourſe of ſuch a ſubject as this, every way ſuitably to, and worthy of it ſelf. But as I have herein uſed diligent care and conſideration; ſo I can free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, I have every where endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured impartially to diſcover, and faithfully to expreſs the <hi>truth;</hi> and have never uſed any unworthy Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, to evade or <hi>obſcure</hi> it. And therefore, if the ſober and judicious Reader ſhall in any thing of leſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as I hope he will not in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of great moment) diſcern any miſtake, I ſhall preſume upon his Candor and Charity. In the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of handling things, I have avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:94072:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>nothing which I apprehended to be a difficulty or conſiderable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of objection: but in the return of Anſwers, and the uſe of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to confirm what I aſſert, I have oft purpoſely omitted many things, in themſelves not inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, for the ſhunning needleſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity; and have waved ſeveral things taken notice of by others, for this cauſe ſometimes, becauſe I was not willing to lay any ſtreſs upon ſuch things, as ſeemed to me not to be of ſufficient ſtrength. On this account, for inſtance, in diſcourſing of the Supremacy of Princes over Eccleſiaſtical Officers, I did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on our <hi>Saviour</hi> and S. <hi>Peter</hi> pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tribute, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.24,—27. For though many ancient Writers ſpeak of this as paid to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and ſome expreſſions in the Evangeliſt ſeem to favour this ſenſe; yet I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there is rather greater likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb facs="tcp:94072:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>that this had reſpect to the annual oblation unto <hi>God</hi> himſelf, which the Jews paid for the ſervice of the Temple, to which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Hilary</hi> and ſome other Ancients refer it.</p>
            <p>Yet in <hi>rendring unto</hi> Caeſar, <hi>the things that are</hi> Caeſars, I ſtill reſerve unto <hi>God, the things that are Gods;</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the primary neceſſity of embracing the true Worſhip of God, and the Doctrine and practice of Chriſtianity, and that all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ought to bear an high reverence to the eſtabliſhment of the Kingdom of Chriſt under the Goſpel, and to that Authority, and thoſe Officers, which he hath peculiarly eſtabliſhed therein. But there is a very great miſcarriage among men, that there are thoſe who look upon many weighty things in Chriſtianity, as if they were merely ſecular Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and were no further neceſſary to be obſerved, than for the ſecuring
<pb facs="tcp:94072:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>men from outward penalties. Theſe men do not obſerve and conſider, that there lyeth a far greater neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, of keeping and valuing the <hi>Communion</hi> of the Church, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly attending <hi>Gods publick worſhip,</hi> and orderly performing its Offices, with other things of like nature, from the Precepts and Inſtitutions of Chriſt, and from the Divine San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, than from the countenance or eſtabliſhment of any civil Law, or ſecular Authority whatſoever. The lively ſenſe and conſideration of this, was that which ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully promoted and preſerved both Piety and Unity in the Primitive Church, when it had no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Temporal Power. But there muſt be no oppoſition made between <hi>Fearing God, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring the King,</hi> but a careful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of both; and theſe Precepts which God hath joined together, let no man ſeparate.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:94072:11"/>
            <p>And now I ſhall only entreat that Reader, who is inclined to have different apprehenſions, from the main things I aſſert, to be ſo juſt to his own reaſon and Conſcience, as impartially to conſider and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the evidence of Truth: which is the more neceſſary, becauſe truths of this nature are no mere matters of ſpeculation, but are ſuch Rules to direct our practice, which they who are unwilling to entertain, act neither charitably to themſelves, nor accountably to God. And he who is the Father of Spirits direct the hearts of all men into the wayes of Goodneſs, Uprightneſs, Truth and Peace.</p>

For the Roman Biſhop, who ſtill <hi>claimeth</hi> even where he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94072:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>poſſeſſeth not, <label type="milestone">

And from the like cauſe have proceeded divers <hi>exorbitancies,</hi> in <hi>opinion and practice,</hi> concerning the Church and its Government, in another ſort of men. And the want of Conſcientious obſervance of the duties of <hi>ſubjection,</hi> hath too often manifeſted it ſelf in the world, by the ſad effects of open <hi>tumult and rebellion,</hi> all which hath highly tended to the <hi>ſcandal</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. It ſeemeth alſo conſiderable, that almoſt all <hi>Sects,</hi> and erring <hi>parties</hi> about matters of Religion, (and many of them to very ill purpoſes) do nouriſh falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and miſtaken opinions, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>civil power.</hi> They either beyond due bounds <hi>exalt</hi> it ſo high, as not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that reſpect which belongeth to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian inſtitutions,</hi> which is done

And therefore it is a work worthy the care and induſtry, of one who loveth truth and goodneſs, to endeavour the healing ſuch a Fountain of deadly evil, which hath diffuſed it ſelf into ſo many ſeveral ſtreams and Channels.

And the ſame may be ſaid of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Eccleſiaſtical <hi>benedictions,</hi> with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands, and particularly of the <hi>ordination</hi> of ſuch Officers in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, who are to be inveſted with this authority.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. And that this Eccleſiaſtical authority under the Goſpel ſhould be committed to <hi>peculiar Officers,</hi> and not fixed in them who have the civil power, is that which the wiſdom of our Saviour hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who did not call ſecular rulers to be his Apoſtles.

That Chriſtian Princes would be in a very <hi>unſafe condition,</hi> whileſt they act any thing about the affairs of the Church, if they have no better foundation to bear them up, than the pretence of the Popes power to <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with the <hi>laws of God.</hi> Surely had <hi>Justinian</hi> thought,<note place="margin">

And the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> under the law, was as fully diſtinct from the civil power, as the <hi>Church government</hi> under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is; neither of them deriving themſelves from the civil, nor reſolving themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. But in both theſe diſpenſations, as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94072:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> government was <hi>appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> by them, ſo was the <hi>civil</hi> alſo in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>eſtabliſhed;</hi> yet ſo that the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which it hath in the laws of nature, is antecedent unto both.

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:94072:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>thoſe Foreign Churches, from whence they came.

                     <p n="2">2. the chief force of what is ſaid upon the firſt pretence, lyeth in this kind of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, which ſome account plauſible, to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:94072:153"/>wit, That every man hath a <hi>Conſcience,</hi> or capacity of <hi>diſcerning</hi> what is his duty in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> and that what he thus <hi>diſcerns</hi> to be his duty he ought to <hi>practiſe,</hi> and no man ought to <hi>hinder</hi> or reſtrain him: and the conſequence of this is, that concerning the affairs of <hi>Religion,</hi> he ought to be under no <hi>Government,</hi> whether <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtical.</hi> But the vanity and <hi>fallaciouſneſs</hi> of this way of arguing, will ſufficiently appear, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the ſame to a further purpoſe, to which it is altogether as well adapted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>matters of common right.</hi> For it may be ſaid here that man is a Creature endued with principles of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and capacities to diſcern what is <hi>juſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,</hi> and what he diſcerneth to be ſo, he ought to <hi>purſue,</hi> and ſhould be <hi>permitted</hi> ſo to do; and therefore according to the former method of argumentation, he muſt <hi>in civil affairs</hi> be under no Government, and no <hi>judge</hi> ought to <hi>queſtion</hi> him. Now the reſult of all this, and what it would tend to prove is, that <hi>man</hi> is ſuch a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who ought not to be a <hi>ſubject,</hi> or under Government; and from hence it would follow, that all the <hi>Precepts of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> and obedience in the Goſpel, and the whole eſtabliſhment which God hath made, of <hi>Civil and Eccleſiaſtical power</hi>
                        <pb n="276" facs="tcp:94072:154"/>and authority, are all of them oppoſite to the <hi>nature of man,</hi> and to the rights and priviledges of his <hi>being.</hi> And now would it not heartily <hi>grieve</hi> any pious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding man, to ſee by what pitiful pretences men undertake to argue, againſt the inſtitution and <hi>authority of God?</hi>

                        <hi>is it a lighter and more inconſiderable thing, for the ſoul of man not to be faithful to God, than for a Woman not to be faithful to her Husband?</hi> Wherefore ſince it is as eaſy for men of underſtanding, to diſcern the <hi>duty of man,</hi> in the main things of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the Rules of <hi>decency,</hi> as in <hi>civil</hi> matters; it is very requiſite, that with allowance of <hi>reaſonable liberty</hi> to them who are ſoberly <hi>inquiſitive</hi> about truth, there ſhould be a <hi>reſtraint</hi> upon

But though I would be as <hi>charitable</hi> to all who err in matters of Religion, as may conſiſt with a due <hi>conſideration</hi> of things, yet I cannot account all that to be <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which is by ſome men in the World ſo called.<note place="margin">Conſcience doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guide where its name is pretended.</note> For thoſe proper <hi>dictates of Conſcience,</hi> which in this caſe ought to <hi>command obedience,</hi> muſt proceed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch convictive <hi>evidence</hi> of truth and duty, which no errour and miſtake can bring along with it, with that <hi>clearneſs</hi> which truth doth; and this ought to be followed by every pious man, whatever difficulties may aſſault him herein; but <hi>paſſions</hi> and <hi>diſordered affections</hi> ought to be governed and <hi>reſtrained;</hi> and the Laws and <hi>Commands</hi> of Superiours ought to be <hi>obeyed,</hi> where there is no ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to be oppoſed againſt them, as I have mentioned. But let any perſon who underſtandeth the ſtate of the World, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether it be not an apparent <hi>ſad truth,</hi> and matter of real lamentation, that the chief and moſt <hi>earneſt</hi> men who cloſe with erring and <hi>dividing parties</hi> amongſt us, do this either out of ſome fond <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
                        <pb n="279" facs="tcp:94072:155"/>to a weak argument, which they are highly <hi>pleaſed</hi> with; or becauſe they are reſolved to hold faſt ſome things as <hi>certain principles,</hi> which have no <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of truth; or that they follow wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and of choice the opinion of ſome <hi>other perſons</hi> whom they <hi>admire;</hi> or have a great <hi>prejudice</hi> againſt thoſe, whom they account an <hi>oppoſite party;</hi> or are not willing to be <hi>ſubject,</hi> and to be guided by their Superiours, in things relating to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And I heartily wiſh it were not ſo plain a truth as it is, that ſuch men are rarely willing to <hi>conſider</hi> ſeriouſly and <hi>impartially,</hi> of what is ſaid againſt their errour, and do not make ſo much <hi>ſcruple</hi> of Conſcience as they ought, of <hi>breaking</hi> thoſe numerous and plain <hi>Precepts,</hi> which enjoin <hi>obedience, humility,</hi> and the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the Church.</p>

That there are ſo many things neceſſary for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this <hi>propoſal practicable,</hi> that even that may well make any man deſpair of its
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:94072:157"/>
                        <hi>effect.</hi> For firſt, care muſt be taken, that there be no ſuch <hi>pious men</hi> in the World, who will think that <hi>Gods honour</hi> ought to be <hi>maintained,</hi> and the true Religion <hi>defended</hi> and ſecured, by the authority of <hi>Governours:</hi> and yet either the <hi>peaceable principle</hi> muſt be forſaken, or elſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon theſe men muſt enjoy the liberty of their <hi>opinion,</hi> as well as others, Secondly, there muſt be ſecurity given, that there ſhall be no ſuch <hi>furious men</hi> in the World, who will at any time vent <hi>notions</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which may tend to <hi>undermine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> and Government, to make mens minds <hi>fierce and cruel,</hi> or to evacuate <hi>obedience;</hi> nor yet that there be any ſuch eager and <hi>earnest men,</hi> who will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to uſe what power they can gain, for the <hi>establiſhing</hi> their own opinions. Thirdly, as this propoſal can never become <hi>uſeful for peace,</hi> until all men be brought to be <hi>of the opinion</hi> of the propoſer, which is as unlike as any thing can be; ſo even then there muſt be ſome proviſion made, that the <hi>practice</hi> of this propoſal, be not the ready way to hinder the <hi>effect</hi> thereof. For the practice of this <hi>general liberty</hi> for all opinions in Religion, doth according to common experience ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily beget, inſtead of peace, <hi>diſcords, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, diſturbances, confuſions,</hi> and

Fourthly, And there muſt be no men ſo far <hi>Christians</hi> and conſcientious, as to acknowledge that there are any doctrines of <hi>Faith,</hi> duties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>worſhip,</hi> or <hi>inſtitutions</hi> of Chriſt, ſo neceſſary and ſacred; that the <hi>oppoſers</hi> or <hi>contemners</hi> of them, ought to be <hi>check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>withſtood.</hi> And though he be ſo bold as to aſſert,<note place="margin">P. 68, 69.</note> that <hi>we ought not to teach, that any errors in belief overthrow the hope of ſalvation,</hi> and ſpeaks of the hopeful eſtate of perſons, whatſoever <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> they embrace,<note place="margin">P. 70, 71.</note>

                     <p n="10">10. I obſerve, 2.

                     <p n="4">4. But they further argue,<note place="margin">Chriſts Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded by Princes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning in cauſes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticale</note> that it is the <hi>Royalty of Chriſt</hi> to Govern his Church in matters of Religion, and if the Civil Rulers do intermeddle herein, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>invade</hi> Chriſts Kingly Government. To which I anſwer. 1. That this way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing put into other language, would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to thus much, That becauſe Chriſt is the <hi>King of his Church,</hi> or of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, yea and of all the earth; therefore Chriſtians and the whole World, ought not to be <hi>ſubject</hi> to any <hi>other King</hi> or Ruler but to Chriſt. And this would ſerve the deſign of the higheſt <hi>Fifth Monarchy men,</hi> if it had any weight in it. 2. It is a groſs falſhood, that no act that Chriſt doth <hi>as King,</hi> may be performed by any other King. There are ſome great things in the <hi>Kingly power of Chriſt,</hi> which are wholly <hi>incommunicable</hi> in the nature of them, to any other human perſon whomſoever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing founded on his <hi>Mediatory Office.</hi> Such are his giving the <hi>Sanction</hi> to the Laws and Precepts of the Goſpel, to become the <hi>rule of the Chriſtian Religion;</hi> his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign <hi>diſpenſing</hi> divine <hi>grace</hi> upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:94072:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>of his own merits; his pronouncing the <hi>final ſentence</hi> of Abſolution and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and his having by a peculiar <hi>right</hi> an <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal authority</hi> over all the World; <hi>all power in heaven and earth</hi> being committed to him. And all ſuch things as theſe, are as far diſclaimed from <hi>Kings,</hi> as from other men. But there are other <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>Chriſts Government</hi> of his Church, where ſome thing of like nature, ought to be performed by others, though in a different manner: thus Chriſt <hi>ruleth</hi> Chriſtians, and ſo may all Chriſtian Kings do; Chriſt doth <hi>protect</hi> his Church, and ſo ought all Soveraign Powers to do; Chriſt by his Authority <hi>encourageth</hi> the <hi>pious</hi> and devout, and diſcountenanceth the negligent, and ſo ought all Rulers as well as all other good men to do by theirs. 3. If <hi>governing</hi> others with reſpect to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, were peculiar to Chriſt himſelf and his Royal Authority, the authority of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Officers</hi> would by this method become void alſo; for Chriſt hath not conveyed the <hi>peculiarities</hi> of his Royal Authority to them. But as they in their places have authority from Chriſt; ſo the <hi>civil power</hi> is in ſubordination to him, who is <hi>King of Kings,</hi> and is confirmed by him.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Popular Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy diſclaimed:</note> Some perſons then who would be thought men of ſenſe, did aſſert, that though the King was own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be <hi>ſupreme Governour,</hi> yet <hi>the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premeſt Soveraign power was in the people.</hi> Others declared that the title of Supreme Governour, was an <hi>honourary title given to the King, to pleaſe him inſtead of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler power.</hi> And in the Iſſue,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>diſprove</hi> the Royal <hi>Supremacy,</hi> becauſe of ſome actions which have been under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by ſome of the people, or by any in their name againſt their Kings, or even to the <hi>depoſing</hi> of them; do firſt ſtand bound to prove all theſe actions to be <hi>regular</hi> and juſtifiable: or elſe it is no better ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, than they might make uſe of againſt the <hi>authority of God,</hi> from the <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience</hi> of men.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Secondly, The aſſerting <hi>ſupremacy of Government</hi> in the body of the <hi>people,</hi> is a poſition big with <hi>nonſenſe</hi> and <hi>irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> 'Tis <hi>nonſenſe</hi> (like a whole Army being General) ſince Supremacy of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the whole <hi>body of the people,</hi> can be over no body; unleſs ſomething could be ſupreme over it ſelf: whereas if there be no higher power than what is in the whole body of the people, this muſt be a ſtate of <hi>Anarchy,</hi> where there is no <hi>ſuperiour or ſupreme.</hi> It includes <hi>Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> becauſe Religion eſtabliſheth the <hi>Government</hi> of a people, to be the <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God:</hi> and whereas Government muſt be by the exerciſe of a <hi>ſuperiour au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> there can be no authority upon Earth <hi>ſuperiour to the ſupreme.</hi>

Even in leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Societies, a <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Maſter</hi> whoſe authority is of an inferiour nature, hath a power of <hi>commanding,</hi> without which there can be no order in Families. And it is the general acknowledgment of the World,<note place="margin">Ariſt. Eth. l. 10. c. 9.

And obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſuch laws is plainly enjoined upon all Chriſtians, ſince they are obliged to be <hi>ſubject to the higher powers,</hi> and to <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:94072:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>themſelves to every ordinance of man.</hi> But that this duty of <hi>obedience</hi> may be the better declared, I ſhall take notice of three pretenſions which are made uſe of, for the undermining it. Wherefore I ſhall obſerve,</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Firſt, That <hi>paſſive obedience</hi> (as ſome call it) or a ſubmitting to penalties, is in things <hi>which may lawfully</hi> be done, no ſufficient diſcharge of Conſcience, or performance of duty, unto the laws of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours.<note place="margin">The neceſſity of Active Obedience.</note> And here <hi>Active obedience</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, deſerves the name of <hi>obedience,</hi> and is neceſſary to be performed. This is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from theſe three things. 1. From the general end and deſign of all Government, which a true <hi>Chriſtian ſubjection</hi> muſt comply with: and this is to <hi>reſtrain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders</hi> and evils, and to <hi>promote</hi> what is <hi>good</hi> and uſeful in the World. Now this end is obtained by the practiſing whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Rules, but is not at all effected by the mere <hi>bearing penalties.</hi> For by the ſuſpending <hi>active obedience,</hi> the order of the World would be turned into <hi>confuſion:</hi> ſince as <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> urgeth in this Caſe, As the ſerviceableneſs of an <hi>Army,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cl. Rom. Ep. ad Cor. p. 49, 50.</note> dependeth much upon its being under Command, and the uſefulneſs of the <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of our <hi>bodies</hi> appeareth, from their being ready to perform the motions, about
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:94072:166" rendition="simple:additions"/>which they are imployed; ſo the good eſtate of the <hi>weal publick</hi> is procured, by mens careful obſerving and attending to uſeful and profitable Rules and directions. 2. From other parallel inſtances. It is againſt the nature of <hi>Religion</hi> to imagine, that wicked men and evil Angels who <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe Gods laws,</hi> and reject his Precepts, are to be eſteemed as <hi>blameleſs</hi> and Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers, meerly becauſe they bear the <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and miſery, which God inflicts. And ſurely no reaſonable man can think, that if a <hi>ſervant</hi> be idle, careleſs, and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; by being only beaten for his fault, without any amendment of his carriage, he becomes thereby <hi>faithful</hi> and innocent: or that if a <hi>Child</hi> be diſobedient to his Parents, and ſtubborn, he hath ſufficiently diſcharged all that duty, which God or Man requireth from him, by being <hi>correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> And the pretence of general perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedience to Governours, by bare ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to <hi>penalties,</hi> but neglecting in things lawful to <hi>practiſe</hi> what is <hi>enjoined,</hi> is as oppoſite as theſe former inſtances, to the Rules both of Reaſon and Religion. 3. From the Sanction of <hi>puniſhment</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them who do evil, and are diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. For God who is ſo juſt that he will not <hi>condemn</hi> the righteous, nor <hi>puniſh</hi> the innocent, hath committed to Rulers the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:94072:166" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>power of the ſword,</hi> to execute puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the diſorderly and diſobedient: which he would never have done, if the neglect of active obedience to laws, which is the cauſe for which puniſhments are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, were not in it ſelf <hi>a fault.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 20.2.</note> But <hi>whoſo provoketh him</hi> (a King) <hi>to anger,</hi> ſinneth <hi>againſt his own Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. Secondly, Nor are ſubjects diſobliged from obeying the <hi>laws</hi> of their ſuperiours, by their entertaining <hi>doubts or ſcruples</hi> concerning the lawfulneſs of them. But becauſe what I have written elſewhere, is ſufficient for the proof of this, I ſhall chiefly refer the Reader thither, and ſhall only add, 1. That if we conſider <hi>doubts</hi> in themſelves,<note place="margin">Doubts do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from obedience.</note> ſince here is no <hi>certain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> concerning the unlawfulneſs of the things commanded; if theſe <hi>doubts</hi> and ſcruples proceed from a regular and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <hi>cautiouſneſs of Conſcience,</hi> there is as much reaſon (if not much more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the plainneſs of the commands of obedience) to ſcruple or doubt of the <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> of <hi>diſobeying,</hi> as of the lawfulneſs of <hi>obeying.</hi> And ſo the conſideration of doubts and ſcruples, taken ſingly and alone, can be no pretence againſt the <hi>performing obedience,</hi> when even theſe very things ought to have as ſtrong a force, againſt the <hi>neglecting obedience.</hi> 2. If we conſider
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:94072:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>the duty and ſtate of <hi>ſubjection,</hi> it will thence appear, that it was well aſſerted by S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cont. Fauſt. l. 22. c. 75.</note> that ſubjects may and ought to <hi>obey</hi> their Princes Commands, where they are certain that what he Commands, is not againſt the <hi>Command of God;</hi> and even where they are <hi>not certain</hi> that it is ſo. And indeed if an <hi>uncertain doubt</hi> did but make it ſafe not to perform obedience, this would bring very great <hi>confuſion</hi> and diſorder into the World, and would teach it the ready way, which many would li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten unto, how <hi>children</hi> might ſafely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey their Parents, and <hi>ſervants</hi> their Maſters, as well as <hi>ſubjects</hi> their Governours. But ſince next to the obeying God, we owe obedience to our ſuperiours, even by the <hi>command of God:</hi> no man can war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably <hi>diſobey</hi> them, but where he knows he hath in that Caſe, the <hi>Command</hi> or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God to the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Thirdly, Whereas many perſons are prone in general to account them, who are leaſt ſtudious to comply with the <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of men, (though they be their <hi>Governours</hi>) in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> to be men of the greateſt <hi>Conſcience</hi> and integrity, who do not affect the things of this World, nor aim at their own intereſt therein: even this is a perfect miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and a groſs miſtake. For 1.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:94072:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>Since the due performance of <hi>obedience</hi> in things <hi>lawful</hi> is a duty,<note place="margin">Performing obedience is a part of integrity and good Conſcience.</note> there is more integrity and <hi>good Conſcience</hi> in the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>practiſing</hi> it, than in the <hi>neglecting</hi> it. This may receive greater clearneſs by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it with the parallel Caſe of <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Parents.</hi> Now that perſon who ſhall <hi>forſake</hi> or diſobey <hi>Father or Mother,</hi> in a neceſſary Caſe of Religion, acteth as one truly <hi>pious:</hi> but he who will be <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient</hi> to his Parents in things lawful, is far from ſhewing himſelf thereby to be the better man, or the better Chriſtian; in that he may ſeem not to conſult his own <hi>intereſt</hi> in the World, by venturing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe or provoke his Parents, and to loſe thoſe advantages and favours, he might by a dutiful carriage receive from them. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuch empty pretences to plead for <hi>diſobedience,</hi> we muſt acknowledge the truth of what <hi>Hierocles</hi> aſſerted,<note place="margin">Hier. in Pythag. p. 53.</note> even from the principles of equity and reaſon, that <hi>Parents</hi> are no where elſe to be <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed,</hi> but where themſelves are not <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient</hi> to the divine Precepts. And the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Princes is of a like nature.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. 2. They who ſeem to diſregard their own <hi>intereſt,</hi> in ſome things in the World, and not to deſire the <hi>favour</hi> of their <hi>ſuperiours,</hi> do not deſerve to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the better or the wiſer men; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

                     <hi>Origen</hi> tells us, that the Chriſtians of his Age were not ſo far beſides themſelves, and void of reaſon, as to <hi>diſpleaſe</hi> and <hi>provoke</hi> Princes, further than this was the effect of their obſerving the laws of God.<note place="margin">Aug. de Haereſ. c. 69.

                        <hi>That Arms may be taken by the Kings Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> though the King never own them, or give any Commiſſion for them, yea though they be) <hi>against his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or against thoſe which are Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionated by him.</hi> And this Poſition,<note place="margin">Taking Arms by the Kings Authority againſt his perſon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed.</note> expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſacred perſon of the <hi>King</hi> to the higheſt danger, and being againſt the ſafety of his Life and Crown, is juſtly declared to be traiterous; and it ſtandeth charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with theſe enormities.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Firſt, It is ſo <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> as to be againſt the common ſenſe of Mankind. Would it not look ſtrange, and be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a prodigious thing, to ſee a Company of <hi>Children or Servants,</hi> beat and abuſe the perſon of their <hi>Father or Maſter,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs him by violence, and poſſibly at laſt to confine and <hi>murder</hi> him; and yet to expect that all men ſhould believe, they did this for the preſervation of his <hi>Right and Government,</hi> and in obedience to his <hi>Authority;</hi> yea, though he plainly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and <hi>proteſted</hi> againſt theſe things, as being heinouſly injurious and unnatural.
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:94072:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>And it is no leſs unaccountable to pretend the <hi>Kings Authority,</hi>

Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. de foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere, p. 66.</note> for taking Armes againſt his <hi>perſon.</hi> This is, as it hath been expreſſed, a like contradiction in ſenſe, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and polity, as <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is in Religion; both which muſt ſuppoſe ſuch a preſence, as is impoſſible to be there; and is contrary to the plaineſt evidence. This pretence of the Kings <hi>Authority</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his perſon, was hatched under the Romiſh Territories, and made uſe of in the <hi>Holy League</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> In the <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> attempts againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the Third,<note place="margin">Hiſt. of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Wars of <hi>France, l. 5. an. 1588.</hi>
                        </note> it hath been related as a matter of wonder to the common ſenſe of men, that they ſhould beſiege the <hi>Loure</hi> where the King was, and yet this ſhould paſs under the diſguiſe of <hi>obeying the King</hi> and <hi>defending the King</hi> and Country. That the name of the <hi>King</hi> doth denote the royal perſon who govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is the general apprehenſion of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And it is vainly pretended that all the proceedings of <hi>juſtice,</hi> being always in the <hi>Kings name,</hi> and by his Authority, when many of them are not particularly known to his <hi>perſon;</hi> muſt require the forming ſuch a legal <hi>Idea</hi> or Notion of the King as is diſtinct from his perſon: but this ſuppoſeth the Soveraign Authority to be in his <hi>Royal perſon,</hi> under whom and from whom, other Miniſters of Juſtice do exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:94072:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>their ſeveral Offices. As when any man intruſts another, to manage any part of his buſineſs and affairs in his name, and by his Authority, this doth not make the man who commits the truſt, to become an <hi>Idea or Notion,</hi> diſtinct from himſelf or his <hi>perſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Secondly, This ſtrained perverting of plain ſenſe in this particular, is not only againſt the ſecurity of the <hi>King,</hi> but may upon the ſame foundation become <hi>fatal</hi> to the lives of the <hi>ſubjects.</hi>

                        </note> For whereas ſome who managed this conceit, did aſſert in plain words, that even the Statutes which condemned <hi>treaſon</hi> againſt the King, had reſpect to the <hi>King</hi> in this Novel <hi>Idea,</hi> as intending thereby the <hi>Laws</hi> and the Kings Courts of <hi>Juſtice:</hi> it is eaſy to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, that any <hi>ſubjects,</hi> who ſhall ſtand in the way of ſuch an ill-deſigning party of men, or ſhall diſpleaſe them, may eaſily be charged with <hi>treaſon,</hi> and thereby be cut off, upon pretence of oppoſing the <hi>Laws and Government</hi> when the very diſcharge of honeſty and integrity may be ſo accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Thirdly, They who made uſe of this <hi>Poſition,</hi> did give the World ſufficient proof, that it was only a <hi>deſigned pretence,</hi> to ſerve a <hi>preſent turn.</hi> For when in our late ſad commotions, they uſed the Plea of
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:94072:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>the <hi>Kings Authority,</hi> in acting againſt his perſon, before they had murthered his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; they then laid aſide alſo all pretence of reverent regard to the Kings <hi>Authority,</hi> and by ſeveral Acts as they were called,<note place="margin">Acts <hi>May</hi> 19. 1649. <hi>and of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> July 17. 1649.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the <hi>ſupreme authority of England</hi> to be in the <hi>Commons,</hi> not at all regarding this Ideal Authority of the King; which if they had been true to their own notion, muſt have been acknowledged ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And they then required the <hi>Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to be taken, to be <hi>true and faithful,</hi> (not to the Kings Laws and Government, according to their own Idea, but) to <hi>the Common-wealth of England, without King, &amp;c.</hi> Which is evidence enough, that thoſe men intended as much to act againſt, and oppoſe the true <hi>Regal dignity</hi> and authority, as the perſon of that excellent Prince: and that this diſtinction was not only void of <hi>truth and juſtice</hi> in it ſelf, but of <hi>honeſty</hi> and good meaning alſo, in theſe contriving men, who were the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The laſt part of this Clauſe of the acknowledgment,<note place="margin">Taking Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them who are Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by the King un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</note> hath reſpect to them who are <hi>commiſſionated by the King:</hi> the ſenſe of which muſt be meaſured from the intent and tendency thereof, which is to ſecure the <hi>Kings ſafety,</hi> and Government, and to maintain the Subjects <hi>true allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
                        <pb n="359" facs="tcp:94072:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>and fidelity. And therefore I doubt not to aver, that the uſe of quirks and ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceties,<note place="margin">Manual. p. 102.</note> in ſuppoſing ſome <hi>extraordinary Caſes,</hi> which are inconſiſtent with theſe duties, and which we may well preſume or hope may never be in act, ought not to be conſidered in making this acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Wherefore to ſupppoſe that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of any King of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently <hi>ſurprized</hi> and ſeiſed by any ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ill-deſigning men (which I truſt will never come to paſs) and they ſhould by force or fraud, <hi>extort Commiſſions</hi> from him, againſt his loyal Subjects and Friends: this acknowledgment concerning the <hi>ordinary duty</hi> of Subjects, doth not take in ſuch <hi>extraordinary fictions</hi> of imaginary Caſes, which are not fit to be ſuppoſed; but they who are the Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Officers, ought to reſiſt ſuch evil men who <hi>offer violence</hi> to his perſon, for the good both of the King and Kingdom.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And alſo that Caſe which ſome put, of the King granting a <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> againſt the legal power which he hath <hi>committed</hi> to a <hi>Sheriff,</hi> or againſt any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which himſelf hath given, and doth continue to other Officers; is ſuch an unreaſonable and undutiful ſuppoſition of <hi>croſs Commiſſions,</hi> which no good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ought to make, or to conſider in this
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:94072:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>acknowledgment.</hi> Only in ſuch an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Caſe, where any perſons whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in any Office or Commiſſion, ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Authors or Abetters of <hi>Sedition or Robellion,</hi> and oppoſe the <hi>Kings Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and Government, it is reaſonable to be expected that the King will grant <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions</hi> to ſuppreſs and reduce them. And ſince no Office or <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> either can, or is intended to warrant any man to act againſt his <hi>Loyalty</hi> and Allegiance; ſuch revolting Officers ought to be <hi>oppoſed</hi> by them, who are impowered and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by their Prince ſo to do, nor is it to be ſuppoſed, that this <hi>acknowledgment</hi> doth at all aſſert the contrary. But the true ſenſe of this clauſe is, that it is a <hi>trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous deſign.</hi> and therefore to be <hi>abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> for the Kings Subjects, without any <hi>command</hi> from their Prince, to <hi>take Arms</hi> againſt thoſe, who act by vertue, and in purſuance of his <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> regularly granted to them. And that theſe words of this acknowledgment, may be reaſonably taken in this fair and <hi>juſt ſenſe,</hi> is evident from the reſult of what I have above diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed,<note place="margin">B. 1. Ch. 6. Sect. 1.</note> concerning the ſenſe and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation</hi> of ſuch publick Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And it was reaſonable for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evaſions, that this acknowledgment,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:94072:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>condemning the <hi>taking Armes</hi> againſt them who are <hi>Commiſſionated</hi> by the King, ſhould be declared in ſuch general termes. If only taking Armes againſt the <hi>Kings perſon,</hi> ſhould be diſclaimed in a ſtrict ſenſe, then the <hi>fighting</hi> the <hi>Kings Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> deſtroying his Subjects, <hi>reſisting</hi> his Government, and thoſe who are inveſted with his Authority, which are the uſual methods of the moſt open and <hi>daring Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> would not be provided againſt. But theſe are the higheſt <hi>oppoſitions</hi> againſt the King, which the moſt diſloyal Subjects can ordinarily make, by taking up <hi>Armes;</hi> who cannot probably act immediately againſt his <hi>perſon,</hi> unleſs they can firſt van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh thoſe <hi>loyal ſubjects,</hi> who are his <hi>ſtrength and defence.</hi>

<pb n="430" facs="tcp:94072:231"/>ſome expreſſions, which will make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that that learned man was not ſo fixed in this Poſition, concerning the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Government,</hi> but that he ſometimes much inclined to, and plainly embraced the contrary aſſertion.

                        <note place="margin">The Goſpel makes no new model for the rights of all politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> the more neceſſary, is this; becauſe ſo far as I can diſcern, it is an aſſertion which cannot be maintained or defended. That there is in this particular, any ſuch <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> between the State of the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and the <hi>New,</hi> as that it ſhould be lawful for <hi>Subjects</hi> before the coming of Chriſt, and particularly for the Jews, to defend their Liberties or Religion <hi>by War</hi> againſt their Soveraign; but it is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unlawful for all Subjects under <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi>
                        <pb n="431" facs="tcp:94072:231"/>by the peculiar Precepts of the Goſpel. For though it is manifeſt, that the ſpirit of the Law and the Goſpel do very much <hi>differ,</hi> and that <hi>meekneſs</hi> and peace are more peculiarly recommended in the Goſpel, by the Precepts, and by the example of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> both to Rulers and Subjects; yet I ſee not how Chriſtianity doth alter the model and frame of humane <hi>political Societies,</hi> ſo as to <hi>debaſe</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or <hi>deprive</hi> them of any rights or freedoms, which they did before enjoy. It is indeed truly obſerved by S. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Chryſ.

And he who will aſſert this, muſt grant it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful for any <hi>Soveraign Prince,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his free profeſſion of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> which is one of his <hi>juſt rights,</hi> againſt an external force which would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a <hi>contrary Religion</hi> upon him;<note place="margin">Euſ.

                     <p n="5">5.

                        <hi>and be guiltleſs?</hi> For as S. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> noted, when <hi>David</hi> declared <hi>Saul</hi> to be the <hi>Lords anointed,</hi> he did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to have Gods Authority, and that to reſiſt him was, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <note place="margin">Aug. Quaeſt. ex Vet.

                     <p n="6">6. Some poſſibly may here urge, that the Laws and Rules of <hi>right,</hi> and all the Precepts of <hi>Religion</hi> amongſt the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> were there eſtabliſhed antecedently to the being of the <hi>Royal Authority</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; and that theſe things ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Divine Authority, no King had any power to <hi>repeal</hi> or break them; and on this account, they might have liberty from the nature of their Conſtitution, to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi> theſe rights by the <hi>Sword,</hi> though Chriſtians have not. But even this alſo will not alter the Caſe. For throughout all the World, the common Rules of <hi>right</hi>
                        <pb n="434" facs="tcp:94072:233"/>and <hi>juſtice</hi> have a divine ſtamp, and are of as great Antiquity as the World it ſelf, and the nature of man: and there is ſcarce any <hi>Kingdom</hi> in the World, which hath continued without interruption of its <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi> and eſtabliſhment, ſo long as the <hi>doctrine of Chriſtianity</hi> hath been in the World,<note place="margin">Tert. Ap. c. 4. Cl. Alex. Strom. l. 4. Orig. cont. Cel. l. 1. l. 5. &amp; l. 8.</note> which peculiarly is from God. And however, no <hi>preſcription</hi> can be pleaded againſt the right of God, and the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of Chriſt, no more than it could be pleaded for the eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Pagan Idolatry;</hi> in which Caſe the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Chriſtians conſtantly aſſerted, their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Religion,</hi> to be above that which they owed to the <hi>contrary Laws</hi> and Conſtitutions of humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Wherefore it will be of conſiderable moment, clearly to prove, that <hi>Subjects</hi> in the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> according to the will of <hi>God</hi> under the Old Teſtament, were not allowed in any ſuch Caſes as have been pretended, to <hi>take Armes againſt their Soveraign.</hi> And if this was then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, it is now much more ſo under the diſpenſation of the Goſpel.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Ham. in</hi> Mat. 10. <hi>c.</hi>
                        </note> And by the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of this ſort of men who were called Zealots, there was very much <hi>cruelty</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in <hi>Judea,</hi> many of their Nobles and chief perſons were ſlain,<note place="margin">Joſ. de Bel.

                     <p n="8">8.

<pb n="462" facs="tcp:94072:247"/>more forward and active. Such I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was the action of <hi>Phinehas, Numb.</hi> 25.7, 8. in purſuance of <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>judgment, v.</hi> 5. as alſo the War un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by <hi>Mattathias</hi> and his Sons, and <hi>Mattathias</hi> his killing the Jew, who, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the command of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> openly ſacrificed according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 2.23, 24, 25.

                     <p n="9">9. Thirdly, In the Jewiſh Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth which was peculiarly ordered by God, ſome <hi>Prophets,</hi> and men extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily inſpir'd, not other zealous men at large, were <hi>empowered</hi> by <hi>Gods Authority,</hi> to do ſome extraordinary actions, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe had not been warrantable; and it is be this ſpecial <hi>authority of God,</hi> not by their own <hi>zeal</hi> only, that ſuch things were allowable.

                     <p n="3">3. Firſt, That the agreement of the <hi>whole body of the people,</hi> or the chief and greater part thereof, can give no ſufficient authority to ſuch an enterpriſe; becauſe the <hi>whole community</hi> are Subjects, as well as the <hi>particular perſons</hi> thereof.

And the ſame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears

Thirdly, This liberty may as reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be given to a few <hi>private perſons,</hi> as to the whole people; becauſe in ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes of the people, they are counſelled by, and are generally <hi>influenced</hi> and led, according to the motions of a few <hi>private perſons.</hi> Fourothly, The Laws of God againſt any evil actions, and conſequently againſt <hi>reſiſtance,</hi> do not become void, by any <hi>great numbers</hi> joining together, in practiſing what is contrary unto them. When the <hi>primitive Chriſtians</hi> were the chief part of the Roman Empire, they durſt not take up Armes againſt the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,</hi> out of the fear of God, as hath been ſhewed. No ſin is to be eſteemed the leſs but the greater when a <hi>multitude</hi> ſhall be actors in it. If any violence be offered to a Father or Maſter, this is not the more allowable if all his Children or Servants join in the <hi>Confederacy.</hi> And when great multitudes engage in open <hi>inſurrections,</hi> the conſequents thereof may be much more dreadful, and calamitious to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: whereas the embodying of <hi>ſmall numbers,</hi> are the leſs to be feared, becauſe the more eaſy to be <hi>ſuppreſſed.</hi>

                     <p n="6">6. Now the deſign of theſe learned men, is thus far herein to be much appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that they though it neceſſary to take care, that whilſt the Right and <hi>Authority of Princes</hi> was aſſerted, the ſafety of the people and the <hi>common good</hi> ſhould ſtill be provided for. Yet becauſe I conceive theſe anſwers to leave things too looſely, and afford over-much occaſion for unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et ſpirits to lay hold on, I ſhall endeavour to ſpeak a little more cloſely to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Wherefore I aſſert, 1. That there is a great difference, between the diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of ſuch things as mere <hi>notional ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,</hi> and the conſidering them as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>practice and reality.</hi> In the former way there may be <hi>ſuppoſitions</hi> made, of things which actually <hi>are not,</hi> never were, nor are ever like to be; and there may alſo be ſuppoſed ſuch <hi>evidence</hi> as is clear, and beyond all poſſibility of miſtake,
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:94072:281"/>when there is no ſuch thing in reality. And only upon the yielding ſuch ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I ſhall grant the anſwer given to be true. Thus the River <hi>Thames</hi> may be granted to be hurtful and <hi>pernicious,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuppoſition that it ſhould overflow and drown the whole Kingdom: but though ſuch a thing may be <hi>imagined</hi> in ſpeculation, men of common underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot much fear any ſuch <hi>actual dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> Now the taking <hi>Armes</hi> is not a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but a matter of <hi>fact;</hi> and therefore the reaſon and ground of ſuch undertake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, muſt be from things as they actually and really are in the World.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. I aſſert Secondly, That if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this as a Caſe of <hi>practice,</hi> which is that to which our <hi>publick acknowledgments</hi> alſo muſt be referred, this pretence is no ſufficient Plea for Subjects to <hi>take Armes;</hi> upon theſe two reaſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the <hi>unreaſonableneſs</hi> of the thing ſuppoſed, and the great <hi>unlikely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> of its ever being <hi>true.</hi> though it may be ſo <hi>pretended.</hi> For ſuch a thing proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly never was actually in the World: and <hi>Grotius</hi> acknowledgeth,<note place="margin">Grot. ubi ſup.</note> that this can ſcarce ſeem <hi>poſſible to happen,</hi> in a King who is <hi>compos mentis</hi> towards his whole Dominions.<note place="margin">Adv.

And it ſeemeth conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, that S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Prohibition againſt <hi>reſiſtance,</hi> was written to the <hi>Romans,</hi> within a few years after the end of <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula</hi> his Reign, and about the entrance of <hi>Nero,</hi> and therefore was a <hi>firm rule</hi> and binding obligation, even under their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. I know it is not <hi>ſimply impoſſible,</hi> that ſuch a Caſe ſhould be in <hi>act.</hi> If <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> had been really King of <hi>Judea,</hi> while he reſolved to <hi>deſtroy</hi> all perſons, of the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> this had been a Caſe of ſomewhat like nature, and upon this Foundation <hi>Barclay</hi> alſo goes,<note place="margin">Ibid. l. 6. c. 24.</note> to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify the Wars of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> of which I have given another account. But though
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:94072:282"/>it be not <hi>utterly impoſſible,</hi> yet there is as much or more reaſon, for thoſe <hi>Children</hi> who <hi>maintain</hi> and ſupport their Parents by their <hi>induſtry,</hi> to fear the theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents do deſign to poyſon them (becauſe there have been ſome unnatural and <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine Parents</hi>) than that Subjects ſhould fear any ſuch deſign of their Prince, againſt his whole Realm. And ſuch Children might with as much juſtice attempt the <hi>murdering</hi> of theſe Parents, upon ſuch ſuſpicions, which would be horrid and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane; and Subjects upon the mentioned pretence, take Armes againſt their <hi>King;</hi> both having equal appearance of ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and being <hi>defenſive;</hi> and both being <hi>impious</hi> and oppoſite to Righteouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Chriſtianity.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. 2. The other reaſon is from the <hi>dangerous effects,</hi> and great miſchief, that hath been, and ſtill may be in the World, by proceeding upon ſuch pretences. For he who doth obſerve, that <hi>Moſes</hi> who was ſo great a deliverer of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was charged by them in their murmurings, as one who intended to <hi>ruine</hi> and <hi>deſtroy</hi> them, and that this was done not only <hi>once,</hi> but <hi>frequently, Ex.</hi> 16.3. <hi>Ex.</hi> 17.3. <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.13, 14. and that they ſpake to like purpoſe concerning <hi>God</hi> himſelf, <hi>Num.</hi> 14.2. <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.27.
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:94072:283"/>may diſcern, that upon ſmall or no occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the ſuſpicions of <hi>diſcontented</hi> ſpirits, carried on by plauſible inſinuations, will eaſily pretend to <hi>certain evidence</hi> of the deſign of <hi>ruining</hi> the people, in the beſt Governours, to the neglect of their duty, and the diſturbance of <hi>peace</hi> and quiet. It is manifeſt both in our own and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that much <hi>Chriſtian blood</hi> hath been ſhed, by giving way to ſuch <hi>falſe ſurmiſes</hi> againſt truth and <hi>Chriſtian Charity.</hi> And it is to be expected that male-contented perſons, if they have any ill enterpriſes, will ſhell them over with the <hi>faireſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences</hi> they can take up, as a diſguiſe for themſelves,<note place="margin">Duct.
